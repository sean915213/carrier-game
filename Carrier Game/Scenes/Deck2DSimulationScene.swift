// TODO LATEST:
// Need to move items with comment "// INSTANCE -> BLUEPRINT COMMENTED LOGIC" to simulation logic vs. editing (static) logic
// Created classes that inherit from the base simulation classes (ie. this one and DeckSimulationViewController). Need to add commented simulation logic to these so that they share the basic functionality (should be done) but also add the necessary simulation logic
