// TODO: ALMOST CERTAINLY MAKE GRIDRECT A CLASS DUE TO TONS OF USES OF RANGES??

/// Represents a rect in game (similar to CGRect in 3D) but uses a slightly different coordinate system where a rect of size 1, 1 and origin 0, 0 only contains the origin coordinate. Each 1x1 grid section has origin at bottom left for purposes of determining whether floats are contained.
struct GridRect {
    
    var origin: GridPoint3
    var size: GridPoint3
    
    // TODO: Cannot make lazy due to struct limitations. But could be expensive to constantly use for contains, etc. Should be class instead? Need to benchmark at some point.
    // TODO: ORR- Can just store a constant that gets initialized lazily? Seems to be a weird workaround to struct mechanics.
    // NOTE: Must turn stride into array as typical methods (at least `contains`) do not work properly on negative strides
